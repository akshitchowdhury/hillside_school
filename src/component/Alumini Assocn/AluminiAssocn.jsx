            There is something decidedly not of this century about the evening dresses—and they are almost all
            evening dresses, with a few soigné jumpsuits and pencil skirts in the mix—that she crafts from
            unembellished satins, cadys, and organzas, with hems cropped just above the ankle.

            You could say Barbara Casasola has had a charmed run. After a critically acclaimed London Fashion Week
            debut last September, the Porto Alegre, Brazil–born, London-based upstart was tapped to be the sole
            women's wear presenter at Pitti Uomo, the biannual menswear trade show in Florence, an honor previously
            accorded to Peter Pilotto and Rodarte. There is something decidedly not of this century about the
            evening dresses—and they are almost all evening dresses, with a few soigné jumpsuits and pencil skirts
            in the mix—that she crafts from unembellished satins, cadys, and organzas, with hems cropped just above
            the ankle.

            The cousin had a point. Consider Casasola's spring/summer 2014 lineup, which, inspired by the work of
            Brazilian constructivist master Lygia Clark, explores the duality of discipline and sensuality: There is
            something decidedly not of this century about the evening dresses—and they are almost all evening
            dresses, with a few soigné jumpsuits and pencil skirts in the mix—that she crafts from unembellished
            satins, cadys, and organzas, with hems cropped just above the ankle. "A lot of people think it makes you
            look shorter," says Casasola of her preferred silhouette. "But it's the other way around."
